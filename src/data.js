        "Maybe I've just been reading the wrong books as of late, but it seems to me that fantasy is getting away from the DnD style adventuring party. When I was growing up on fantasy everything seemed to fit into the trope. Dragonlance, Forgotten Realms (Yes I realize those are litterally Dnd settings) Sword of truth, Wheel of Time, Sword of Shannara.\n\nNow all the books I read seem to revolve around cities, politics, wars and no one is going on quests for macguffins anymore. Now don't get me wrong, I love a good war. As a veteran and a writer of Military fiction I am no stranger to the tides of battle. But sometimes I want to sit on my couch and read about a crafty rogue, wise old wizard, and burly warrior setting off to defeat a dragon and get a shiny cup.\n\nI know that all art forms grow and change with their generations, but it makes me wonder why writers used to dream of going on long treks through stranges lands with wonderful companions, and now they don't. Or maybe they do, and I've just been getting a lot of similar recommendations. \n\nSo what are your thoughts /r/Fantasy? Am I coming out of left field? Or does nobody want to team up with weirdo's to find old magic crap anymore? \n",

        "As the title says I'm looking for a book with similar theme/setting as Dragonlance but that is somewhat made with an adult audience in mind. I'm 23 now and hadn't read Dragonlance since I was maybe 16. I tried reading them recently and they just didn't seem to hold up. This isn't a knock against the books since they are obviously targeted at younger audiences.\n\nDragonlance is the best example I can think of but specifically what I'm looking for is:\n\n1. **High Fantasy**\n2. **Magic** in the world (more heavily/apparent than something like ASoIaF or Riyria Revelations)\n3. **Different races** (elves, dwarves, humans, halflings, edit: or anything else!)\n4. *BONUS:* Focuses on a **2-3+ party** of adventurers\n5. *BONUS:* Hard to describe but defined **\"classes/roles\"** whether it be the classic D&D classes (Warrior, Mage, Paladin) or like Mistborn's different Allomancers (Coinshots, Tineyes, etc.)\n\nI'm very open to any suggestions. I'd love to hear about any books even if they don't meet all the very vague criteria I set up above :)\n\nI really appreciate the help and will try to answer questions if anyone has any, thanks!\n\n**EDIT**: Just wanted to post some previous books I have read and enjoyed, not all related to my above list:\n\nDragonlance, Eragon, Name of the Wind, Game of Thrones (watched), Lord of the Rings, Wheel of Time, Riyria Chronicles, Steelheart, Mistborn, Way of Kings.\n\n**EDIT EDIT:** Overwhelmed by all the help and great suggestions! I'm trying to narrow down my choices as to which to start first but I hope to read many of them. Thanks!",

        "Spoilers.\n\nSorry for it being the middle of the night in most parts of North America, but I just gorged myself on the last 200 pages of Words of Radiance (Stormlight Archive) in the past 2.5 hours [yeah, I speed read, but its never lead me astray. And WoR is over 1000 pages!).\n\nIt has to be the best goddamn book I've read in a very long time. Lord of the Rings remains at the top of my list, but now I'm questioning whether its more sentimentality than anything. [tangent: Lord of the Rings was my first serious fantasy, and spawned my love of the genre and of reading]\n\nSorry this is rambling, but I just have to let thoughts out before they kill me.\n\nI was impressed by Way of Kings, but didn't consider it monumental or earth-shattering. WoR, though, the way it upped the ante, and the way it started tieing loose ends from WoK, I was on the edge of my seat.\n\nSome things:\n\n1) The Diagram. Crap, that whole chapter with Taravangian... and the Ghostbloods are basically sleepers...\n\n2) Shallan. Yeah, super jealous of Adolin right now. Witty, pretty, a fantastic drawer, aaaand a Radiant?\n\n3) The variety of characters and points of views. With Way of Kings, I was hesitant when it came to the interlude chapters and the random one-off characters, but now... this world Sanderson has created is one of the most diverse and engaging I've ever stepped into. Who knows, maybe I haven't read enough, lord knows I haven't done as much as when I was younger. This could all be post-read hype and in the morning I'll find faults but... I doubt it.\n\n4) Dalinar. The blackthorn. What more needs to be said?\n\n/end rant/",

I can recall many fantasy stories of many different medias that have romance story's but very little to no sex that isn't fading to black or immature. For as much focus so many fantasy stories have on big battles and extremely violent scenes, something as common and every day as sex is virtually never made in the same quality.

        "I only had time to read one book in December, thanks to life, the universe, and everything conspiring to take over all my free time. That book was *Slow Regard*, which I read on a lazy Christmas afternoon. I absolutely loved it, and wanted to share some key thoughts that help shed a whole, whole lot of light on Auri.\n\nAuri has OCD.\n\nNot \u201cOMG, I\u2019m so OCD!!!!!\u201d kind of OCD where someone needs to keep all the bills in their wallet in order. The real kind. The clinical anxiety disorder. As someone with a loved one with severe OCD, it couldn\u2019t be more obvious.\n\nThe feeling that something just isn\u2019t *right*. The need to repeat the same action over and over again until it clicks. Things like her blanket being unable to touch the floor, and it being unusable for her ever again the moment it does. Her reaction to not having access to soap, and her need to keep washing over and over again, even though she knows it won\u2019t help her feel better without soap. The need to do things in the right order. The sense of panic and intrusion from knowing that someone just *might* be in her space, the space she has so perfectly ordered and controlled in a way that no one else can understand.\n\nAnyway, that being said, I\u2019d like to go an a little bit of a rant.\n\nHaving read *Slow Regard*, I poked around for a bit looking to see what people had said about the book. Some liked it, some loved it, but lots of people didn\u2019t, and their  complaint usually boiled down to: \u201cIt didn\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d And so, I\u2019d like to say: maybe that\u2019s because it wasn\u2019t supposed to.\n\nI love a good plot, and I love a good story. But if all you want to know is the plot, you can just read a synopsis. A good story is so much more than that. Not every book, chapter, paragraph, sentence, and word is meant to advance the plot. Sometimes the author is trying to fill in backstory. Sometimes the author is trying to slow things down to build tension. Sometimes the author is trying to let us get to know the characters better, or just give them a chance to interact when not distracted by the goblin hordes or scheming nobility.\n\nPeople complain about this with regards to *Slow Regard*, *A Dance with Dragons*, many of the middle *Wheel of Time* books, chapters spent travelling, and I wish people would stop and think about what these things are actually *doing*. *Slow Regard*, for instance, is a wonderful window into the mind of a wonderful character, and the world of the Four Corners is richer for it.\n\nAll in all, I feel like complaining about the plot not advancing is like ordering a tasting menu and complaining about portion sizes. Not always the case, certainly - sometimes books just bog down. But often.\n\n**TLDR**: Journey before destination.",

        "I feel like the trilogy would have been so much better if it had taken a more straight up approach to sexuality and \"romance\". This has got to be the first series where I felt estranged by how the sexuality was handled. The main characters are supposed to be in love, and they end as a martyr couple, but nowhere is it mentioned if they had sex or not. Hell I don't think they even kissed. The plot and story was so good, but the fact that the romance and love felt so artificial and fake really put me out of it. I didn't really get a feeling that Vin and Elend even liked each other until the very end of the story. When the highest point of affection and \"love\" they show each other is Vin sitting on Elend's laps, yet at the same time face down world eating apocalyptic death monsters, that just feels so jarring. I've read shonen mangas that have dealt with romance better than in Mistborn. I understand that Sanderson is a Mormon and all, but I never got this feeling while reading Orson Scott Card's books, which have all been rather forthcoming when dealing with sexuality when they get to it.

I'd like to invite you all to join me, I plan on starting with Kristen Britain's *Green Rider* series, as I read the first book ages ago when it was new, but nothing since the rest of the books have come out.

Now with limited reading time, I catch myself just wanting more of the same and not really wanting to try new authors for fear of wasting my time.\n\nMy main problem is that I don't know I want something new until I've already read it. For example, this past week I read two series I've been avoiding for a year now (Raven's Shadow and Powder Mage) because I didn't think I'd like them. Now that I've read them, I like the hell out of them. Last year I did the same with Lightbringer and Riyria. The year before it was Dresden Files.\n\nSo what books/series have been this way for you guys? Anything you've put off reading because you didn't think you'd like it, only to realize how great it was once you finally started? ",

From what I remember of the book, the main character, I think his name started with a 'V',  was on the run from his powerful family. I think he had stolen an important book from them. 'V' ends up being mugged and left for dead, but he is found by an order of monks. They take him in and care for him. I don't remember what happens then, but eventually his sister finds him and means to drag him back home. She calls him Foolheart, a name her brother hates.  Sorry I can't remember anything more about the story. I would love to be able to find the title of this book. I read it when I was too young to appreciate it and I would love to try again. That, and I'm sure there is a sequel that would complete the story. Thanks everyone!",

Probably the best thing I've done for myself ever since I stopped eating triple deep-fried, mayonnaise-battered, bacon balls.\n \nBouncing back from that inappropriate non-sequiter: I'm sort of calling out to any artists here that know a thing or two about drawing certain fantasy races. Namely physically morphed beings like dwarves?\n\nIt's easy to find a tutorial or reference shot about Orcs, Elves, Humans, etc; but it's hard to find specific guidelines in regards to races like dwarves, halflings, or even gnomes.\n\nSo I was hoping this thread had a couple of vets that've been through this and can offer some wisdom on the more physically diverse races in fantasy.\n\nThanks and Happy New Year",

        "Hey, new to the subreddit, and just wanted to talk about this book for a bit. \nThe only other books of hers I've read were the Soldier's Son Trilogy and I loved it, although every time I mentioned her name all anyone could talk about was her 'Assassin' series (which I'm now guessing is Farseer/Liveship Traders/ Tawny Man books?) I asked for this book for christmas because I foolishly didn't do my research and thought that it was the first book in the Assassin series I'd heard so much about. \nIt was not, but it hooked me, and now I want to go back and read all about Fitz and his life as a young man.\nBasically, I have completely fallen in love with Hobb as a writer and the things she makes my mind and heart do. Very few authors can keep me glued to the final pages like she can. \nMy burning questions at the end of Fool's  Assassin are [spoiler](#s\"What the hell is happening with those evil, torturing servant people?\") and [spoiler](#s\"Is Bee going to be okay?\") and, of course, [spoiler](#s Does the Fool live or die? Because I may actually grieve if he dies, and I haven't even read the earlier books.\") Oh, and finally, [spoiler](#s How can Fitz be so thick as to not realise that his daughter is a White Prophet? I mean... just... just EVERYTHING about her screams 'White Prophet'. A neon sign pointing to her with the words 'WHITE PROPHET HERE!!!' wouldn't convince him. But I still love him and Bee. Of course.\") So yeah, I just loved the book, wanted to get some speculation off my chest and to express my adoration for this infuriating woman's writing. \n\nThanks for making it through this post. :)  ",
